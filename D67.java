You are given a binary string s. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:

Type-1: Remove the character at the start of the string s and append it to the end of the string.
Type-2: Pick any character in s and flip its value, i.e., if its value is '0' it becomes '1' and vice-versa.
Return the minimum number of type-2 operations you need to perform such that s becomes alternating.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal.

For example, the strings "010" and "1010" are alternating, while the string "0100" is not.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "111000"
Output: 2
Explanation: Use the first operation two times to make s = "100011".
Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s = "101010".

  class Solution {
    public int minFlips(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int res = n;
        int[] op = {0, 0};

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            op[(s.charAt(i) ^ i) & 1]++;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            op[(s.charAt(i) ^ i) & 1]--;
            op[(s.charAt(i) ^ (n + i)) & 1]++;
            res = Math.min(res, Math.min(op[0], op[1]));
        }

        return res;
    }
}
